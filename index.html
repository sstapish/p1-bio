	<h2>Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communication Design</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Minor in French</li>
		<li>Minor in Psychology</li>
		<li>Minor in Communication Studies</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="constrain">I started college through Running Start at Eastern Washington University. Like many freshman, I was unsure of what I wanted to do, but I looked forward to the possibilites. I took many of the core classes to try out several different fields before I declared a major in Communication Studies. After a couple quarters of Communications classes, I realized that while I really enjoyed the classes, I didn't really want the jobs that field would lead to. I had been considering a minor in Visual Communication Design, but  I decided to make it my major. I love my classes, have a 3.8 cumulative GPA, and will be graduating in December 2014.</p>

	<h2>Background information</h2>

		<p>I grew up on the West side of Washington and moved to Spokane at the beginning of highschool. I was homeschooled all the way until I went to Running Start through EWU. I was also involved in several extra curicular activites including swim team, synchronized swimming, band, and Spokane Youth Symphony. I also have a passion for words and books, which led me to a job with Spokane County Library District. I've worked there for over 8 years now working my way up through the positions.</p>

	<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>

		<p>My goal is to obtain a position with an organization where I would be able to work with a team to conceptualize, design, and deliver messages or advertisements. This would help me to grown and develop as a designer and help further the goals of the complany. I believe this would be a good starting position and eventually I would like work independently as a freelance designer. </p>
