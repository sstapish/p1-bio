	<p>I started college through running start. Like many freshman, I was unsure of what I wanted to do, but I looked forward to the possibilites. I took many of the core classes to try out several different fields before I finally declared a major in Communication Studies. After a couple quarters of Communications classes, I realized that while I really enjoyed the classes, I didn't really want the jobs that field would lead to. I had been considering a minor in Visual Communication Design, but  I decided to make it my major. I love my classes, have a 3.8 cumulative GPA, and will be graduating in December 2014.</p>
